# **Control Flow**

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is `true` and to run some code repeatedly while a condition is `true` are basic building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and loops.



## if Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”

**Syntax**

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```



### else if (multiple conditions)

You can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if` expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. 



## Loops

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

### While Loops

```rust

let mut i = 0;
while i < 5 {
    println!("{}", i);
    i += 1;
}
```
